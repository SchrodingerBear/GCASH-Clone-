# Simple GCASH Simulator 🪙
This Simple GCASH Simulator is a simplified replica of the GCASH app, created solely for educational purposes. Its primary and only feature is the ability to change and display a simulated account balance using JavaScript 💰. The GCASH Simulator does not involve real money or any complex features 🚫💲, but in future developments, this will become a real GUI 🖥️ and not just a simple project as it is now.
